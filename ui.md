# Clean & Professional Frontend Upgrade – Virtual Tour Website

## Role
You are a **senior frontend architect and UI/UX designer** specializing in **premium virtual tour and immersive experience platforms**.

---

## Objective
Analyze the **existing frontend** of my virtual tour website and **upgrade it to a clean, modern, and professional interface** while preserving all existing functionality and avoiding regressions.

The final result should feel **enterprise-grade, immersive, and production-ready**.

---

## Step 1: Mandatory Analysis (DO NOT SKIP)
Before making any changes:

1. Analyze the current:
   - Frontend structure
   - Components
   - Routes
   - Styling system
2. Identify:
   - UI clutter
   - Poor spacing or alignment
   - Inconsistent typography
   - Inconsistent colors
   - Heavy or unnecessary animations
   - Mobile responsiveness issues
3. Clearly confirm:
   - Components that will remain unchanged
   - Components that need refinement
   - Components that need redesign

⚠️ **Do NOT modify backend logic, APIs, or data flow.**

---

## Step 2: Design Principles (Strict Rules)
Apply the following principles consistently:

- Minimalistic and premium design
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing system (8px / 16px / 24px)
- Limited color palette (maximum 2–3 brand colors)
- Clean, modern typography  
  *(Inter / Poppins / SF-style fonts preferred)*
- Smooth, subtle animations only
- High contrast and accessibility-friendly
- Avoid flashy or distracting effects

Design quality benchmark:
**Apple / Airbnb / Google-level polish**

---

## Step 3: Virtual Tour–Focused UX
The website must feel **immersive and exploration-first**:

- Full-screen or near full-screen hero section
- Clear primary CTA: **Start Tour / Explore**
- Minimal distractions during tours
- Floating UI controls instead of bulky panels
- Elegant loading states for 3D / 360° assets
- Smooth transitions between scenes
- UI should never obstruct the tour experience

---

## Step 4: Pages & Components to Improve
Ensure professional-quality design for:

- Landing page (first impression must feel premium)
- Tour viewer interface
- Navigation (sticky, minimal, intuitive)
- About / Information sections
- Contact or Booking section (if present)
- Footer (clean, minimal, informative)

---

## Step 5: Technical Constraints
You must follow these constraints strictly:

- Make **minimal changes** to the existing structure
- Reuse existing components wherever possible
- Add new components **only if absolutely necessary**
- Ensure:
  - Mobile-first responsiveness
  - Fast load times
  - No breaking changes
  - No layout shifts
  - No performance regressions

---

## Step 6: Output Requirements
After completing the update, provide:

1. A clear summary of changes made
2. Before vs After improvement explanation
3. Explicit confirmation that:
   - No existing features were broken
   - Performance was not degraded
   - Codebase integrity is preserved

---

## Quality Bar
The final frontend must feel:

- Professional
- Trustworthy
- Premium
- Immersive
- Commercial / SaaS-grade

If the result does **not** meet enterprise-level quality, iterate and improve until it does.
