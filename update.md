# Kuula Virtual Tour Features: Complete Breakdown

Kuula is a leading 3D 360-degree virtual tour software designed for real estate, architecture, photography, and business presentations. Below is a detailed breakdown of the comprehensive features available on the platform, ranging from core editing tools to advanced business integrations.

---

## 1. Core Virtual Tour Editing

### Drag-and-Drop Tour Builder
A user-friendly editor that allows you to upload multiple 360-degree panoramic photos, arrange them, and connect them into a seamless virtual tour in minutes. The editor supports drag-and-drop thumbnail connections, making the creation of walkthroughs highly intuitive.

### Walkthrough Mode & Transitions
Create a sense of movement between rooms or spaces. Walkthrough mode allows users to click an arrow and smoothly transition to the next 360-degree panorama, mimicking the experience of physically walking through a space. You can customize the animation style of these transitions.

### Universal Camera & Render Support
Kuula supports panoramic images from virtually any source. Whether you shoot with a 360 camera (Ricoh Theta, Insta360), a traditional DSLR, or render 3D images using architectural software (like Twinmotion or Lumion), they can all be uploaded and shared. It even supports non-panoramic (flat) images.

### Batch Editing & Level Correction
To save time, Kuula allows you to apply changes to all posts in a tour simultaneously. It also includes tools to correct the horizon level of your panoramas, ensuring your tours look perfectly straight and professional.

---

## 2. Interactive Elements & Hotspots

### Interactive Hotspots
Hotspots are clickable icons placed within the 360-degree space that transport the viewer to another panorama. Kuula offers a library of standard icons, but also allows PRO users to upload custom icons (SVG/PNG) to match specific branding.

### Interactive Info Cards
Enhance your tour by adding pop-ups that contain rich media. When a user clicks a specific area, an info card can appear displaying text descriptions, image galleries, embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos, Google Maps, or lead capture forms.

### Audio & Voiceover Support
Elevate the immersion of your tours by adding background music or ambient sounds. You can attach a global audio track to the entire tour or add specific audio clips and voice-overs to individual hotspots and rooms.

### Floor Plans & Maps
Integrate 2D floor plans directly into the virtual tour. Users can click on different rooms on the floor plan map to instantly teleport to that location within the tour. It also supports GPS and location data integration using Google Maps.

---

## 3. Branding & White-Labeling (PRO & Business)

### Custom Branding & Logos
Replace the default Kuula interface with your own company logo. The Business plan allows you to manage multiple logos, which is ideal for agencies creating tours for various clients.

### Custom Domains (Domain Masking)
Host all your 360-degree content under your own website domain (e.g., `tours.yourcompany.com`) complete with SSL security. This keeps your clients on your website and boosts your own brand equity rather than Kuula's.

### Nadir Patches (Tripod Removal)
Easily cover the "nadir" (the bottom pole/tripod area visible in 360 photos) with a customized mask image or your company logo, creating a clean, professional look.

---

## 4. Sharing, Privacy & Security

### Export Editor & MLS Compliance
A feature-rich exporter that lets you customize the embedded player settings (auto-play, auto-rotate, UI controls). Crucially for real estate, it offers a "chromeless" player option that strips all branding and links, making the tour compliant with strict MLS (Multiple Listing Service) regulations.

### Unlisted & Private Tours
Share content privately with clients or stakeholders before going live. Unlisted tours are only accessible to those with the direct link, keeping them out of public feeds and search engines.

### Password Protected Tours
For highly sensitive or exclusive content, the Business plan allows you to lock entire virtual tours behind a secure password.

---

## 5. Analytics & Performance Tracking

### Google Analytics Integration
Measure user engagement with deep Google Analytics integration. Track visits to individual tours, see where users are clicking, measure the performance of specific hotspots, and monitor traffic across different embedded locations.

### Landing Page Editor
Kickstart your virtual tour business with a built-in content management system (CMS). Build a dedicated, SEO-friendly landing page directly on Kuula to showcase your portfolio and services.

---

## 6. Accessibility & Viewing Experience

### WebXR Virtual Reality (VR) Mode
Viewers can explore your 3D 360 tours using Virtual Reality headsets (Meta Quest, Oculus, Google Cardboard) directly through the web browser. No app installation is required.

### Mobile Optimization
Tours are automatically optimized for mobile devices, leveraging the phone's gyroscope so users can look around by simply moving their device.
